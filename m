If the RMM isn't playing ball then we're in trouble whatever. Refusing
to talk to the RMM ensures that we wouldn't be able to reclaim any of
the memory that has been donated to the guest (or related RMM metadata).
It also doesn't rule out that a faulty RMM has left a minefield of
"delegated" memory which could cause a GPF at any moment. In reality the
only "safe" option is to BUG() the kernel and completely give up.

But the chances are that the RMM hasn't suddenly become malicious, and
in most likely the situation is that we've hit a corner case which in
the RMM which is highly likely to only affect the one guest.
"panic_on_warn" is available for those who would prefer the system to
stop in these situations.

And of course it's entirely possible that the bug is in Linux and the
RMM is playing ball it's just that I've screwed something up. In which
case the realm VM is probably screwed, but the rest of the system
(including other guests) should be absolutely fine.

I can of course code up a "rmm_is_bugged" flag and litter the code with
paths to handle that - but I can't imagine that's actually what you
want. Although please do let me know if I'm wrong, I seem to have
misplaced my mind reading hat ;)

I'm not sure how to make it "safer" - I don't think there is a
completely "safe" option for this "should never happen" case.

Thanks,
