Thanks for your confirmation. For every respin of the arm/cca host series,
I try to give it a test to make sure nothing gets broken in my coverage.
For this specific revision (v14), more time was actually spent to rebase
Jean's qemu (branch: cca/latest) to upstream so that I can do the tests.

Lets wait for a while to see what we will have in v15 and the qemu series
you're going to post, and I will give it another try.

One unrelated question is 64KB granule size, it's not supported by upstream
TF-RMM "main" or "topics/rmm-v2.0-poc_2" branch, not sure about the plan
when this will be supported in TF-RMM. Since 64KB isn't supported by TF-RMM,
I was unable to test 64KB page size.

Upstream EDK2 doesn't support realm guest yet even some of related commits
have been merged. So I still use linaro's one at "https://git.codelinaro.org
/linaro/dcap/edk2  (branch: cca/latest).
  
Thanks,
Gavin
