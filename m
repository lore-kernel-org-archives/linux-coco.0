What do you mean by making it "mandatory for VMMs"? If you mean PSCI is
always forwarded to user space then I don't think it's going to make
much difference. Patch 27 handles the PSCI changes (72 lines added), and
some of that is adding this uAPI for the VMM to handle it.

Removing the functionality to allow the VMM to handle it would obviously
simplify things a bit (we can drop this uAPI), but I think the desire is
to push this onto user space.

Yes the fd is the vcpu calling PSCI. As you say, this is for the return
value to be set correctly.

I'm not entirely sure what you are suggesting. Do you mean why are we
not just writing to the GPRS that would contain the result? The issue
here is that the RMM needs to know the PA of the target REC structure -
this isn't a return to the guest, but information for the RMM itself to
complete the PSCI call.

Ultimately even in the case where the VMM is handling PSCI, it's
actually a combination of the VMM and the RMM - with the RMM validating
the responses.

Good spot. In practice this works because >2GB in one operation is
highly unlikely to be processed in one go. But I guess I'll change this
to have an output size argument. I guess I could make the kernel update
all of base,size,source_uaddr which would simplify user space.

Thanks,
Steve
