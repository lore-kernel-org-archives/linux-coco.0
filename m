Nope. The Host doesn't keep track of the levels at which the S2 mapping
is created nor does it track the "RIPAS" of the regions. That check is
making sure that we don't unnecessarily break down "block" mappings.

e.g., Before boot, the host might set RIPAS for certain regions (e.g.,
populated contents.) The Guest (firmware) could at boot then convert
all of the "DRAM" regions to RIPAS_RAM without checking what was
populated (this is anyway available in the Measurement). Thus a
conversion request may encounter regions that are already in the
requested state (RIPAS_RAM in the above case). And thus RMM
can report SUCCESS if it is already in the state.

Otherwise, we now need to split the block mapping to a deeper level
to apply the "state" change to a subset of the "block" range. This
is why we return RMI_ERROR_RTT when the requested RIPAS doesn't
match the "ripas_pre"

Does that help ? Remember that we don't have the concept of "ACCEPT"
in CCA.

Cheers
Suzuki
