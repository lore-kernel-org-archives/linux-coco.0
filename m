Looks like at least at the moment it's much more one-way than the SRO
mechanism - there's no reclaim mechanism (yet).

Yeah I'm not sure quite what is best. I expect the RMM to only request
contiguous memory for very small allocations to use as hardware page
tables. It's an issue I'm trying to work through that the specification
doesn't provide any guidance for what sort of allocations the host
should expect to provide.

The spec is unfortunately not prescriptive on this point. For an
operation which eventually fails, the expectation is that the RMM will
return all the memory that was provided (and exactly that memory). But
the specification doesn't actually require that.

The problem is that there are situations where a racing operation on
another CPU could trigger this to not happen. For example, a new page
table needs to be allocated to complete a map operation, but then a
racing operation on another CPU makes use of this page table (e.g due to
a map at a different address), the memory for the page table cannot be
returned even if the operation doesn't complete because it's in use from
the racing operation.

I don't believe the current RMM design will actually do this - but it's
not something we actually want to prevent in the spec.

Equally the expectation is that all the donated memory for a guest will
be returned when the guest is destroyed. But we don't have anything in
the spec to enforce this.

I don't particularly expect a pool to be that useful for the expected
memory allocation patterns as I expect SRO donations to be long lived.
We don't (yet at least) have a concept of donating memory just for
"scratch" memory during an operation. Although the SRO mechanism doesn't
rule that out.

Thanks,
Steve
