We don't care about freshness of measurements. What we care about is
that the device has remained continuously locked while we are doing
this.

Generation should not have anything to do with the # of evidence
collected, it should be tied to the lock event. We do a lock and we
get a generation number. That number remains fixed and could be passed
into run as a minor sanity check.

However the real security work is in the kernel driver which is
required to actively detect/prevent any host tampering with LOCKED.

RMM does this with a trio of sequences counters maintained by the
kernel driver: lock_seq, meas_seq, report_seq

If the host tampers with things then the sequences computed by the
driver will not match those computed by the RMM and it will fail.

So, I don't care if we lock the device and then collect three
evidences for some reason. It is not the APIs problem to make sure
they are all the same, or that the one used for attestation is
"freshest". 

While locked the device is not supposed to change its measurements,
allowing that turns locked into complete security nonsense. How do you
know when the measurements stop changing to actually measure it?

The only point here is to collect some evidence that represents the
start time of a continuous period of exclusive guest control.

Have I got this wrong somehow?

Yeah, I bet this is common.

Sounds right to me

I'd expect to be able to learn the exact nonce sice that the challenge
can support. It should probably be a list not a range, then you could
include 0 for SPDM..

And maybe other lens if we do crypto agility here or something.

The challenge is formed into the returned token so it is a kind of
ABI and we don't want things like transparent 0 pad or something, so
userspace does have to know..

Makes sense, this is also where someday having the memfd as an option
might be nice since it could be dynamicaly sized by the kernel

I'm a bit puzzled by this optional challenge concept, I haven't tried
to read SPDM spec yet, but it really has a way to omit the challenge
from the reply? It doesn't just replace it with 0 or something?

I would have naively guessed this should inherent from some SPDM family?
