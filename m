I'm not sure what the current thoughts on the matter are, but there was
an intention in the past that some data could be measured and some not
within a region which is logically the same. E.g. the DT might be
deliberately unmeasured so that the same measurement would cover a
selection of different configurations (with the guest obviously
validating that it was sane before continuing). Forcing the memory to be
split into multiple memslots just so a measurement flag can be set
correctly seems like a poor uAPI.

While splice(2) certainly looks similar to what we want, it does
(according to the man page at least) have the requirement that "one of
the file descriptors must refer to a pipe" which seems less than ideal
for the DT case where it's likely to be generated in memory by the VMM.
Or is my man page out of date and the pipe restriction isn't there in
the kernel?

Thanks,
Steve
