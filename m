I'm not sure why you are not OK with setting the bit[31:16] to 0 ...

... and why bit[31:16] need to be preserved (as much as possible) to 
what to the last (attempted) entry to the guest.

Here KVM is emulating an EXIT without really Entering the guest, and the 
emulated EXIT is different to the previous handled one. If KVM preserves 
the bit[31:16] of the previous EXIT, wouldn't it be likely to cause the 
bit being counted twice? I think KVM needs to clear the bit[31:16] 
unless the specific EMULATED EXIT requires them to be preserved.

yeah. This looks good to me.
