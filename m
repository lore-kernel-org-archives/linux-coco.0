With my KVM hat on, this option looks very attractive.

And with the caveat that I'm most definitely not an attestation expert, fro=
m a
separate of concerns perspective, IMO it seems like the report should conta=
in the
TD-specific information while the quote just wraps that information in plat=
form-
specific goo.

In other words, to me, TD-scoped quotes feel like a hack that was thrown in=
 to
avoid having to modify the guest because y'all didn't plan ahead.
