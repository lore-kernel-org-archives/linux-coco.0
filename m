Yep, my bad.

Correct. KVM deals with "GFN" and as such masks the "protection" bit,
as the IPA is split.

Good question. GPC is only applicable for memory accesses that are 
actually "made" (think of this as Stage3).
In this case, the Stage2 walk causes an abort and as such the address is
never "accessed" (like in the normal VM) and host handles it.
In case of a "shared" memory page, the "stage2" mapping created *could*
(RMM doesn't guarantee what gets mapped on the Unprotected alias) be
mapped to a Granule in the NS PAS (normal world page), via 
RMI_RTT_MAP_UNPROTECTED. RMM only guarantees that the output of the
Stage2 translation is "NS" PAS (the actual PAS of the Granule may not
be NS, e.g. if we have a malicious host).

Now, converting a "protected IPA" to "shared" (even though we don't
share the same Physical page for the aliases with guest_mem, but
CCA doesn't prevent this) would take the following route :

Realm: IPA_STATE_SET(ipa, RIPAS_EMPTY)-> REC Exit ->
        Host Reclaims the "PA" backing "IPA" via RMI_DATA_DESTROY ->
        Change PAS to Realm (RMI_GRANULE_UNDELEGATE)

Realm: Access the BIT(39)|ipa => Stage2 Fault ->
        Host maps "BIT(39)|ipa" vai RMI_RTT_MAP_UNPROTECTED.

The important things to remember:

1) "NS_PROT" is just a way to access the "Aliased IPA" in the 
UNPROTECTED half and is only a "Stage1" change.
2) It doesn't *change the PAS* of the backing PA implicitly
3) It doesn't change the PAS of the resulting "Translation" at Stage2, 
instead it targets a "different IPA"->PA translation and the resulting
*access* is guaranteed to be NS PAS.
