Sadly the nearest I found to a link directly to the PDF is:

https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/69cb945ac1586b7c59b1c00c

But I have 0 confidence that that link will work for long (if indeed it
even works for others now!). If you know of any way of getting a better
link out of the Arm website that I'm all ears!

Do you really think

 		u8 padding3[SZ_4K - SZ_256 * 3];

is better? I certainly don't. I'll give you (SZ_4K - 0x300) is tempting.
Although it then makes the BUILD_BUG_ON idea below somewhat pointless.

I'm sure we can make use of

BUILD_BUG_ON requires being in a function. But static_assert() can be
used in the header by the struct definitions - I'll add that, thanks for
the suggestion.

I'll look into the possibility of generating the headers. While dull and
error prone I have found it is sometimes useful for forcing a review of
the spec itself. There have been a number of bugs I've found (and have
been corrected) in the spec while writing the header files - it's very
easy to skim read those parts of the document otherwise.

Writing the structures out in a "more abstract way" might be a good
idea, but I'm just a little wary of writing another tool which is only
used in this one spot. The RMM structures are somewhat unusual in being
so sparse.

Thanks,
Steve
