Sorry about being unclear this is not the type of hardening I meant
really.  The "hardening" you meant is preventing kernel vulnerabilities,
right? This is what we've been doing for decades.
But I meant slightly newer things like e.g. KASLR or indeed ASLR generally -
we are trying to reduce a chance a vulnerability causes random
code execution as opposed to a DOS. To think in these terms you do not
need to think about attack surfaces - in the system including
a hypervisor, guest supervisor and guest userspace hiding
one component from others is helpful even if they share
a privelege level.

Surely they need ability to control resource usage, not ability to execute DOS
attacks. Current hardware just does not have ability to allow the former
without the later.

I'd say each business has a slightly different business model, no?
Finding common ground is what helps us share code ...
