+=========================
+Attestation userspace ABI
+=========================
+
+A confidential guest proves what it runs to a remote verifier with evidence: a
+statement of its measurements, signed by its root of trust and carrying a
+challenge the verifier chose, and the logs behind those measurements. An
+attestation provider gives its device a node, ``/dev/attestation/attestationN``.
+Through it a program asks for evidence, and reads and extends the measurement
+registers (MRs) the evidence reports.
+
+The node speaks CTLV, described in :doc:`ctlv`, as a descendant of the
+``ctlv-attestation`` family, one family per provider. Every operation below
+belongs to ``ctlv-attestation``, so a tool written against it works with any
+provider. The specification is
+``Documentation/ctlv/specs/ctlv-attestation.yaml`` and the constants are in
+``include/uapi/ctlv/ctlv_attestation_gen.h``.
+
+======================  ======  ==========  ================================
+Operation               Type    Access      Purpose
+======================  ======  ==========  ================================
+device-get              action  read        what the device supports
+evidence-get            action  read-write  evidence objects
+mr-get                  query   read        describe the MRs
+mr-read                 query   read        one MR's values
+mr-extend               action  read-write  extend one MR
+======================  ======  ==========  ================================
+
+``device-get`` is always provided. Every other operation is optional, and a
+device provides those its provider implements, which ``op-get`` lists. The
+errors below are the family's own. Those of the transport, such as ``EACCES``
+for a descriptor without the access an operation needs, are in :doc:`ctlv`,
+and once a device is gone or has stopped, every operation fails with
+``ENODEV``. A provider's own failure returns its errno, such as ``EIO``.
+
+Generations
+===========
+
+A counter tells a program whether what it holds is still current. It is 32
+bits wide. An operation that would advance it past its maximum fails with
+``EOVERFLOW`` and stops the device.
+
+``mr-generation``
+    The state of the MRs. It advances with every extension, and a reply that
+    depends on MR state carries the generation it reflects.
+
+Evidence
+========
+
+``device-get``
+--------------
+
+Describes the device: what it supports and the provider's own information. It
+takes no request. The reply carries:
+
+``caps``
+    A record for each part the device has:
+
+    ``caps.evidence``
+        With ``evidence-get``: one of ``objects`` for each object the device
+        produces, up to 16, as `Objects`_ describes.
+
+    ``caps.mr``
+        With MRs: ``flags``, which has ``extend`` where ``mr-extend`` is
+        provided. ``mr-read`` is always provided with MRs.
+
+``info``
+    The device's family's fields, its ``device-info``.
+
+``evidence-get``
+----------------
+
+Writes each object the request names into a blob the caller supplies. A
+signed object is made by the call, over the challenge, and never reused. The
+others, such as an event log, are read as they stand at the call. One call so
+returns signed evidence with the log needed to check it. The request carries:
+
+``challenge``
+    The challenge, described below. Present exactly when a signed object is
+    named.
+
+``objects``
+    1 to 16 objects, each naming one of the ``caps.evidence.objects`` of
+    ``device-get`` by its ``id`` and giving ``data``, the output blob it is
+    written to, sized as described below.
+
+The reply carries:
+
+``results``
+    One per object, in request order, each giving the object's format in
+    exactly one of ``format`` and ``vendor-format``, and its ``length``, the
+    bytes written to its blob.
+
+``mr-generation``
+    Where an object binds MRs, the MR generation the evidence reflects.
+
+``EINVAL``
+    A signed object is named without a challenge, a challenge is given
+    without one, or its length is one a signed object named does not take.
+    Two objects are the same.
+
+``EMSGSIZE``
+    An object's blob is too short for it. The error information's
+    ``required-length`` says how long it has to be.
+
+``ENOENT``
+    An object's ``id`` is not one ``device-get`` lists.
+
+``EPROTO``
+    The root of trust returned an object in a format the device does not
+    list for it.
+
+Access is read-write. Availability is dynamic: a device may switch the
+operation off for a time, and meanwhile it fails with ``EOPNOTSUPP``.
+
+The challenge
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A signed object binds the challenge. Each signed object lists its
+``challenge-lengths``, up to 8, each one ``length`` or a range from
+``min-length`` to ``max-length``, and the subsystem keeps them within 1 to 4K.
+The challenge has to be of a length every signed object named lists.
+
+Pass a nonce from the verifier, or a hash that binds such a nonce to the
+caller's own context, such as a key the evidence is to vouch for. Never pass
+data a peer chose. Any process that can run ``evidence-get`` can have the
+device sign what it passes, and one that passes a peer's bytes makes the
+device a signing oracle for that peer.
+
+Objects
+~~~~~~~
+
+Each of ``caps.evidence.objects`` describes one object:
+
+``id``
+    0 to 15, which a request names it by.
+
+``class``
+    What the object is, as ``evidence-class`` below says.
+
+``formats`` and ``vendor-formats``
+    The formats it may have.
+
+``max-length``
+    The longest it gets, however many objects a call asks for.
+
+``challenge-lengths``
+    For a signed object, the challenge lengths it takes.
+
+``evidence-class`` says what an object is:
+
+``signed``
+    Evidence the root of trust signs over the challenge. It carries its own
+    signature.
+
+``event-log``
+    The platform's log of what firmware and the boot chain measured into the
+    MRs, for a verifier to replay. Later extends, through ``mr-extend`` or
+    otherwise, are not in it.
+
+A blob of the object's ``max-length`` always holds it. A shorter one saves
+memory where objects run shorter than their bound, as certificate chains do:
+where the object does not fit, ``evidence-get`` fails with ``EMSGSIZE`` and
+returns no evidence, and ``required-length`` in the error information is the
+length to retry with. The retry collects the evidence anew, and may pass the
+same challenge.
+
+Two enums name the formats:
+
+``evidence-format``
+    ``ctlv-attestation``'s, for a layout a standard defines, such as the
+    CCEL, so every family that produces it uses the same value.
+
+``evidence-vendor-format``
+    For a layout one vendor defines, whose values the device's family gives
+    through a CTLV enum extension point.
+
+The ABI check of ``regen`` covers both enums. An object lists the formats it
+may have, from either enum, in ``formats`` and ``vendor-formats``, and the
+reply names the one written in exactly one of ``format`` and
+``vendor-format``. A new layout is a new value.
+
+Measurement registers
+=====================
+
+Extending an MR folds a digest into its value, so the value commits to every
+extension in order. An MR has a value for each hash algorithm it supports, a
+bank. An MR's ``id`` is the device's handle for it, and ``mr-desc`` describes
+it:
+
+``name``
+    The platform's name for the MR, such as ``rtmr0``.
+
+``supported-hash-algorithms``
+    One for each bank, in the provider's order.
+
+``register-index``
+    The hardware's number for the MR, where it has one.
+
+``caps``
+    ``extend`` where the MR may be extended. A provider still refuses an
+    extend the platform forbids at the time, as with ``EPERM`` for a TPM PCR
+    the current locality may not extend.
+
+Every MR can be read, though a read can still fail, as when the caller lacks
+authorization or the platform's state forbids it.
+
+The name, banks, caps and register index describe an MR, and do not change.
+The values change with every extension, so the two are read apart.
+``mr-get`` describes every MR, which is how a program learns the IDs, or the
+one an ID names. It is answered from what the device keeps, while
+``mr-read``, which returns one MR's values, asks the hardware. ``mr-read`` and
+``mr-extend`` take only the ID.
+
+A hash algorithm is a constant of ``enum hash_algo`` in
+``include/uapi/linux/hash_info.h``, such as ``HASH_ALGO_SHA384``.
+
+Nothing reserves an MR, and the kernel does not arbitrate between its
+writers. Any program with a read-write descriptor can extend it, and so can
+the register's own interface, as for a TPM's PCRs. A program that replays an
+MR from its own records has to make sure, through the system's configuration,
+that it is the only writer; ``mr-generation`` counts only the extensions made
+through the device.
+
+``mr-get``
+----------
+
+Describes every MR, in fragments ordered by ID, or only the MR whose ``id``
+the request carries. Each is one of ``items``, with its ``id`` and its
+``mr-desc``, as `Measurement registers`_ lists it. The query's generation is
+the MR generation, so a continuation fails with ``ESTALE`` once any MR has
+changed.
+
+``ENOENT``
+    No MR has that ID.
+
+Access is read.
+
+``mr-read``
+-----------
+
+Returns the current values of the MR whose ``id`` the request carries. The
+reply carries:
+
+``mr-generation``
+    The MR generation of the values.
+
+``mr-values``
+    One for each bank, in ``mr-get``'s order, with its ``hash-algo`` and
+    ``data``.
+
+``ENOENT``
+    No MR has that ID.
+
+Access is read.
+
+``mr-extend``
+-------------
+
+Extends the MR whose ``id`` the request carries. The request carries one of
+``mr-values`` for each bank of the MR to extend, in any order, each a
+``hash-algo`` and a ``data`` of exactly that algorithm's digest size. The
+banks left out keep their values. The device hashes nothing for the caller.
+
+The reply carries ``mr-generation``, the MR generation after the extension.
+
+``ENOENT``
+    No MR has that ID.
+
+``EOPNOTSUPP``
+    The MR cannot be extended, or the provider cannot extend only some of its
+    banks.
+
+``EPERM``
+    The platform forbids extending the MR at the time.
+
+``EINVAL``
+    The request carries no ``mr-values``, a value is for a bank the MR does not
+    have or repeats one, or a digest has the wrong length.
+
+Access is read-write.
