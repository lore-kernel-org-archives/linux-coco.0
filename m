Thank you for taking a look, Steve.

Unfortunately, due to the company's policy, I can't share any details
about the platform I'm currently testing on. When the time is right,
I'll be happy to do so.

Yes, the former makes perfect sense if there would be no systems that
supports CCA without TDIR. However, if such systems do exist, I'd be
interested in exploring the latter approach.

Again, I can't share that right now, but I'd like to share more when the
time comes.

Thanks,
