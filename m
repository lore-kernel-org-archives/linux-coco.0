Yeah, the PA array is an in-memory ABI, which is not constructed in the
newly introduced helper. The construction of an in-memory ABI usually
involves allocating/freeing memory, I remember there was an objection to
allocate memory inside the SEAMCALL helpers.

I think all the confusions come from the differences between "in-memory
ABI" and "register based ABI". The SEAMCALL leaf invoking is always the
register-based ABI. But Some registers reference some shared buffer
which contains the "in-memory ABI".

This patch introduces a helper to wrap the constructing of the
register-based ABI, but doesn't wrap the constructing of the in-memory
ABI, which should be the work of another helper if needed.

All helpers should take kernel data type as input. The previous
"u64 *tdmr_pa_array" is already a kernel data type to represent the
in-memory ABI that is referenced by the register-based ABI, but it is
easy to get confused (u64 * vs u64). So we define a named kernel
structure to clearly describe the in-memory ABI.

Yes, I'm good to the reason to wrap the register-based ABI.

My reading of this paragraph is that we shouldn't wrap both in-memory ABI and
register-based ABI constructions in one helper, cause that may duplicate
allocations and copies. Because otherwise the combined helper should receive
a kernel managed buffer that represents the in-memory ABI but doesn't conform
to its layout, resulting in the extra allocation and copies in the helper.

Do we need to talk about this register-based/in-memory ABI pattern in general?
Not just for TDH.SYS.CONFIG. We already have exsiting examples and more to come,
this is not special to TDH.SYS.CONFIG.
