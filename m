I wonder if there is a plan to develop a dedicated (stand-alone) tool 
that allows a realm developer to calculate Realm Initial Measurements 
for realms. I mean a tool that can be compiled and run on a Linux PC 
machine.

As you know, the remote attestation mechanism requires a verifier to be 
provisioned with reference values. In this case, a realm verifier should 
have access to the initial reference measurement (RIM) of a realm that 
is intended to be run on a remote Arm CCA platform.

The algorithm that measures the initial state of realms (RIM) is highly 
sensitive to the content of a realm memory and the order of RMI 
operations. This means that not only the content of populated realm 
memory matters but also the implementation of the host components (e.g. 
kvm, kvmtool/qemu).In the  of kvmtool-cca, the layout of memory and the 
content of DTB highly depend on the provided options (DTB is generated 
in run-time). Unfortunately, the content of DTB also depends on the 
linking order of object files (the order of DTB generation is imposed by 
__attribute__((constructor)) that is used to register devices). This 
complicates development of a separate tool for calculating RIM, as the 
tool would have to emulate all quirks of the kvmtool.

One of the solution of retrieving Realm Initial Measurements seems to be 
running the whole firmware/software (e.g. kvmtool/Linux host/TF-RMM) 
stack on the FVP emulator and gathering the RIM directly from the 
TF-RMM. This would require a realm developer to have access to the whole 
firmware/software stack and the emulator of the CCA platform.

The other solution would require the implementation of a dedicated tool. 
For instance, a sensible approach could be to extend the functionality 
of kvmtool.

Is Arm going to develop a dedicated, stand-alone tool for calculating RIMs?

What is the recommended way of retrieving/calculating RIMs for realms?

Kind regards,
Piotr Sawicki
