I'm good to these detailed description. I'll add them to the
cover-letter.

Sorry maybe I should say "the firmware design is: 1. Off by default.
2. Must be enabled after basic TDX module ...". I'll try to update the
words.

> "..the saving are little .."

Because for security purpose, these add-on features are always needed,
even if not all of them, so Extensions will most likely be enabled.

And even if someone switched them off all and saved the memory, compared
to the memory of a typical TDX capable system (lets say 1TB), the saving
is still little (0.001%).

The dynamic enabling of the Extensions is not worth.

If we delay the Extensions initialization to the first Extension
SEAMCALL, we need to maintain additional TDX state machine for
lifecycle, and we need mechanisms to synchronize parallel Extension
enabling request from multiple callers.
