This flow is correct, is what users of in-place conversion should do.

"Always" is the wrong word, I should have said "zero if not uptodate
before populate", as in, with patch at [1].

By doing the zeroing in __kvm_gmem_get_pfn instead, by the time populate
gets the pfn, the page would be zeroed, either because userspace faulted
it in, and the zeroing happened in kvm_gmem_fault_user_mapping(), or if
userspace never faulted it in, the zeroing would happen because
populate() allocated the page.

Thank you so much for bringing this up, I hadn't considered this
before. I'll do that when I get to guest_memfd hugepage restructuring.

I see, I only looked at this after commit 2a62345b3052.

I'd say the original uAPI perhaps just didn't document 0 as an
unsupported uaddr. Given that commit 2a62345b3052 already merged, uAPI
was perhaps accidentally changed and no customer complained, I think we
can move forward with 0 as an invalid src_address? I wouldn't think
anyone relies on 0 intentionally being a valid address.

I could document that, if it helps?
