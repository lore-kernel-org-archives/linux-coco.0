This is in the kvmtool code - and yes I agree "work in progress" is a
bit generous for the current state of that code, "horrid ugly hacks to
get things working" is probably more accurate ;)

The issue here is that the two things that realm_configure_parameters()
set up (hash algorithm and RPV) are currently unsupported with the Linux
changes, but will need to be reintroduced in the future. So the contents
of the functions which set this up (using the old uAPI) are just #if 0'd
out.

Depending on the compile flags the code will compile with a warning, but
using __attribute__((unused)) would at least make this clear. I'd want
to avoid the "[[maybe_unused]]" as it's not used elsewhere in the code
base and limits compatibility.

I can reproduce that, a quick fix is to change INITRD_ALIGN:

#define INITRD_ALIGN	SZ_64K

But the code was meant to be able to deal with an unaligned initrd -
I'll see if I can figure out what's going wrong.
