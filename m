The TDX architecture identifies some features that are off by default
but can be enabled by the host during TDX module initialization or
update.

Yes. Previously Xiaoyao asked "why only these bits are add-on features
while the rest in TDX_FEATURES01 are not" [1], so I added these words.

I just try to explain why the add-on feature configuration patch appears
in this extensions series, because it is the prerequisite for extensions
enabling.

From your comment below, seems we don't have to explain this
prerequisite here. Maybe I should delete this part.

I think yes. On version0, r9 is ignored meaning architecturally VMM is
OK to fill any value in r9.

I feel this is historical baggage in the ABI design.

No, there are two more rows in the table to specify: 

According to SPEC, for other feature0 bits whose value is in TDX_FEATURES0,
they must be 0. for bits not in TDX_FEATURES0, they are ignored.

I guess they want to re-use TDX_FEATURES0, they don't want to make new
definition of every bit for each add-on feature. But let me check with
module team.

Good to me.
