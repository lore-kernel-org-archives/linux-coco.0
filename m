Hi Ackerley

Thanks for the writeup, my responses in-line.

Correct.

This was deliberately removed because :

1. Host knows the original request from the VCPU exit.
2. RMM caches the request (range, ripas) in the VCPU object
3. Host confirms to the RMM, complete the RIPAS transition by
    RMI_RTT_SET_RIPAS(), with the values it received from the VCPU exit.
4. RMM matches the range provided by the host to match with the VCPU
    cached request and performs the "ripas" transition as per the
    request from Realm.

As mentioned above, host knows the requested "RIPAS" from VCPU exit.
RMM knows the "RIPAS" from the VCPU object.

Now: Privates vs Shared is translated to RIPAS_RAM vs RIPAS_EMPTY
in the CCA (well, roughly)

RIPAS_RAM implies, the GPA can be mapped into the private address
space of the Realm and it is integrity protected. Host cannot
replace the GPA with another content (it can unmap and DESTROY
the GPA mapping. But unless the Realm consents to replace the
GPA, again via SET_RIPAS request).

Correct.

Please note that, in such cases, RMM needs a deeper page table level
and the error is RMI_ERROR_RTT, indicating to the host that:
Look I need a deeper level table to satisfy the request.

e.g., base = 4K, but walk.level = 2, and ripas_pre="private"

i.e. the requested base is mapped at L2 as block with "private" ripas.
If you want to convert the "base" to shared, it needs L3 table. The host
would follow up with RMI_RTT_CREATE and then retry the request.

nit: rec.ripas_value = empty (shared)

rec.ripas_value == empty (shared) as per the guest request. And the RMM
will find the state is already "shared" and would confirm the success
back to host.

Correct, the guest "permitted" the GPA to be made private with unknown
contents anyway. RMM guarantees that the "data" is scrubbed when the
GPA is made valid. The advantage with this approach is, once the
Guest sets the RIPAS_RAM, the host can lazily donate pages at
fault time

We could keep a list of VCPUs with pending set-ripas request for e.g.
Or before the vCPU enter, we check the state of the region and
do the sync with RMM.
