Hi Elena,

Service VMs might be a niche use-case in the end. But since there is not
much effort needed to make them work I see no reason to not support
them.

Okay, right. Seems like the attacks work on Intel as well, just with a
different outcome. Anyway, the mitigation should work on TDX as well.

We briefly touched that topic in yesterdays development call, it seems
there are diverging requirements for different platforms. Some platforms
do not want to measure any configuration data while others want to
measure at least parts of it.

Currently IGVM is used to pass any configuration data to the SVSM and
the specification requires this data to be unmeasured. So an IGVM
extension would be needed as well to pass measured configuration data.
