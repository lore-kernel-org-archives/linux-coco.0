I could do that, but I was deliberately keeping this as a patch which
contains the uABI interface so that the whole uABI is visible in one
place. I was trying to reduce the amount to review for those who aren't
so interested in the implementation details (especially for this series
where we know it's going to change somewhat with the move to RMM v2.0).

Yes - I'd tried to say that by mentioning it's a "user space pointer",
but I could make that more explicit.

It can be called before or after setting RIPAS and it implicitly sets
RIPAS to RAM (I'll add something to make that explicit).

With RMM v1.0 there's an ugly problem that INIT_RIPAS fails on a region
which is already RIPAS RAM. This should be fixed with RMM v2.0. There's
a workaround in patch 17 currently:

		/* FIXME: Ugly hack to skip regions which are
		 * already RIPAS_RAM
		 */

But that should go away.

Note that with this proposed uAPI there is no mechanism for user space
to directly set the RIPAS - it's assumed that all guestmem_fd regions
should be set to RIPAS RAM at the time of the first VCPU run - which
means the VMM doesn't need to do anything special.

In the future we could consider a guestmem_fd flag or extra ioctl to
allow the VMM to control RIPAS at a finer granularity. But so far we
don't seem to have any compelling reason to expose that.

Thanks,
Steve
