Right, but that is not the kernel's problem. If you run updates on
a module that does not support conflict detection, you get to keep the
pieces.

Like other cases of Linux not wanting to deal with the eccentricities of
early modules, just have userspace know about a minimum module version
where this protocol exists and accept the risk otherwise. No pressing
need to burden the kernel with carrying worry for early modules.

Not really, the log could be simplified to just say "module versions < X
are not safe for runtime update". In general if the kernel had a minimum
supported module version concept it could collect all of these early
deprecation conditions under one check.

Right, assume a minimum module version.

...because if it must be supported, why check?

Why would it be variable? The user tried update on a module that the
kernel deemed unfit for update. "Doctor, it KVM_BUG_ON()s when I run
update".

In the end all of the hand wringing we are doing is misplaced. The root
of the problem is the TDX Module claiming "runtime update supported" to
include these corner cases of "but we corrupt things if the update tries
to replace the crypto library at the wrong time".

That problem is also solvable by not classifying those updates as
runtime compatible, or defining a protocol to mitigate the collisions.

Neither of those was chosen. Instead the module implemented 2 additional
complications Linux chose one that fails update, other VMMs chose one
that maximizes updates at the cost of needing to restart TD
construction.

I think the changelog is a bit non-commital trying to be diplomatic
about the mess. Simply, Linux wanted the easy button, all runtime
updates are safe. Instead, module exported complexity and optionality.
KVM voted for one flavor of that optionality to accommodate the module
complexity.

The solution, make modules with the option KVM wants the min requirement
and move on.
