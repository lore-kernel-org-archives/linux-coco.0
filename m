It's based on the same 'base' as v15 was - it depends on the unmerged
guest_memfd changes. I've just updated to the latest revision from
Ackerley. You've been reviewing the changes, and I've attempted to
update the code based on that valuable feedback.

Clearly I'm not expecting this series to be merged yet - we're waiting
for the guest_memfd changes. If you have a suggestion on how I should
tackle this in the future then please let me know. I could bombard you
with an even bigger series with Ackerley's series on the front, but I
think you'd shout at me even more if I did that.

> Not happening, sorry.

Well I'm off on 'holiday' or more accurately to move house. The new
house's (brand new) hot water cylinder is bust and the plumber is
currently saying we can't even have cold water, never mind hot, so I'm
going to spend the next week worrying about things other than this series.

If you provide review comments then I'll look at them when I get back.

Thanks,
Steve
