Correct, the RMM specification as it stands doesn't provide a mechanism
for the host to do this. The host would have to identify all the realm
guests in the system: specifically the address of the RDs (Realm
Descriptors) and RECs (Realm Execution Contexts). It needs this to tear
down the guests and be able to undelegate the memory.

It's an interesting point and I'll raise the idea of a "firmware
shutdown command" to make this more possible.

I don't have a roadmap I'm afraid for these. kexec in theory would be
possible with KVM gracefully terminating all realms. For kdump/panic
that sort of graceful shutdown isn't really appropriate (or likely to
succeed).

There is also some RMM configuration which cannot be repeated (see
RMI_RMM_CONFIG_SET) - which implies that the kexec kernel must be
similar to the first kernel (i.e. same page size).

Thanks,
Steve
