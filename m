The internal implementation details of extension seamcalls buries the
lead on why this mechanism is important, why Linux should care, and why
this brings TDX in line with the other major CC architectures. Something
like:

===
To date, SEAMCALLs have been short lived routines that monopolize the
CPU for their duration. This limits their utility for implementing
higher order security protocols or pushes complexity into Linux. The
Linux appetite for ingesting complexity is low, so TDX now adds a new
class of SEAMCALLs that are preemptible and resumable. This capability
enables higher order service APIs to carry out a security protocol like
"establish an SPDM session".

The TDX "Extension SEAMCALL" capability is akin to ARM CCA's "Stateful
RMI Operations (SRO)", and achieves similar externalized complexity
relief as a dedicated hardware coprocessor like AMD SEV-SNP. The
mechanism is "give the service environment some memory", "invoke the
service API", and "continue invoking until complete". All protocol state
is internal the service API.

The simplest class of extension SEAMCALLs to support are in support of
"DICE-based TDX Quoting", a service to turn guest launch attestation
reports into a document that can be externally verified.

This confuses the TDX design with the Linux design, and sets up "50MB" as
something to be quibbled with. The Linux design is turn on all the
features that Linux knows about all the time. Unless and until the "any
available, all the time" becomes untenable it just simplifies the init
flow to not play piecemeal games. Await evidence to change the simple
policy. Suffice to say the cost of this policy will burn 10s of
megabytes.

No need to talk about details not in this series. I would maybe just
note that quoting is the simplest first consumer and was chosen as the
lead vehicle over TDX Connect previously posted in case anyone asks.
