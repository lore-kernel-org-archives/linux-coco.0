Subject: [PATCH v16 00/45] arm64: Support for Arm CCA in KVM

This series adds support for running protected VMs using KVM under the
Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA), including the firmware
support needed to communicate with the Realm Management Monitor (RMM).

For v15 the series was split into a 6-patch generic firmware/RMM series
and a 37-patch KVM series. The two parts are combined again for v16, as
requested to allow the complete stack to be tested by Sashiko as a
single series.

The first six patches add the generic firmware layer for talking to the
RMM, as specified by version 2.0-bet2 of the RMM specification[0]. They
provide the RMI definitions and wrappers, discover and configure the
RMM, implement Stateful RMI Operations (SROs), and ensure that the RMM
has GPT entries for host memory. The remaining patches add the KVM
support needed to create, populate and run Realm VMs.

Note that RMM v2.0 Beta 3 specification should be published soon. The
changes introduced in that are minor and I expect this series to be
largely compatible with the new spec.

The RMM v2.0 specification introduces SROs, which allow the RMM to
complete an operation over several SMC calls while requesting or
returning memory to the host. This allows interrupts to be handled in
the middle of an operation and lets the RMM dynamically allocate memory
for internal tracking purposes. For example, RMI_REC_CREATE no longer
needs auxiliary granules to be provided up front, and can instead
request memory during the operation.

The main changes since v15 are:

 * Recombine the firmware/RMM and KVM portions into one series. The
   Realm-specific RMI wrappers remain separate from the generic
   firmware wrappers, in a new KVM patch.

 * Rewrite Realm entry and exit handling to fit into the generic KVM
   run loop. Work which cannot be performed in the entry path is now
   completed through KVM requests, and MMIO, PSCI, RIPAS changes and
   host calls are adapted to the new flow.

 * Rewrite Realm timer support to use KVM's IRQ-ops infrastructure and
   software resampling.

 * Improve SRO cancellation and error handling. Ensure a cancelled
   operation isn't treated as successful, wrapper return values can carry
   negative Linux errors as well as RMI return values, and those errors
   are propagated through the KVM users.

 * Check that the RMM supports the host page size before configuring it,
   and exclude firmware-reserved NOMAP memory when creating GPT entries.

 * Expand the KVM_ARM_RMI_POPULATE documentation to make clear that Arm
   CCA cannot preserve memory contents during an in-place
   shared-to-private conversion.

 * Allocate Realm parameters only while creating the Realm descriptor.

 * Document the encoding of the arm64 VM types and require
   ICH_HCR_EL2.TDIR before advertising or creating Realm VMs.

This series is based on the guest_memfd in-place conversion v9 tree[1],
which is itself based on kvm-x86/next. It is also available as a git
repository:

https://gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/linux-cca cca-host/v16

Work in progress changes for kvmtool are available from the git
repository below:

https://gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/kvmtool-cca cca/v13

The TF-RMM branch used for testing this series is available here:

https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-RMM/tf-rmm.git topics/rmm-v2.0-poc_3

There is a kvm-unit-test branch updated to support the attestation used
in RMM v2.0 available here:

https://gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/kvm-unit-tests-cca cca/v4

[0] https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0137/2-0bet2/
One bet2 change, which moves metadata out of the individual address
range descriptors, has intentionally not been implemented because that
part of the specification is expected to be reverted.
