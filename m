Attestations may be requested by RPCs themselves when a service
decides to allow a user to present their own challenge nonces that
should be included in the hardware attestation. The "once at boot"
workflow only works for a specific type of application.

The whitepaper presents a hypothetical usage of the attestation
facility. It is not prescriptive. With only 64 bytes, you're most
likely to be providing a nonce or a hash, and not a full public key.
Indeed, you may be presenting sha512(nonce || pubkey).

It really is arbitrary. We've also been discussing including hashed
vTPM quotes to tie them to the hardware attestation. That's not
necessarily how it'll be used going forward, but the interface needs
to allow for this flexibility.

I can understand the desire to abstract now that there are 2
datapoints instead of 1, but given that you've said folks aren't keen
on this usage of the key system and developers of these drivers are
also not keen, maybe we should let there be some vendor specifics
until we have a better idea how this will work with more technologies?
RISC-V and ARM have attestation facilities coming, and it might be
hard to shoehorn all their capabilities into this as well.
