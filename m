Upon returning to the EL1 host, the code falls back to `kvm_vgic_sync_hwstate()`, where the VGIC save operation is explicitly skipped for nVHE. Since the EL2 stub was bypassed, `__vgic_v3_save_state()` is never executed, and `ICH_*_EL2` states are lost.

Therefore, KVM needs to add specific logic for this scenario. We would likely need to route the REC exit through a dedicated nVHE EL2 stub to invoke `__vgic_v3_save_state()` before dropping back to EL1, rather than jumping straight back to `kvm_ioctl_vcpu_run()`.

Thanks for the testing. Yes indeed this is an oversight. For now option
1 is what I'm going to go for. There's nothing stopping nVHE mode being
supported but as you note any platform with RME will have VHE so it's
not an immediate priority to support.

One interesting case of nVHE is of course pKVM and for that there needs
to be some significant work to ensure that the EL2 hypervisor
understands the RMM communication and prevent any confused-deputy style
attacks. E.g. the host must not be able to map a pVM's private memory
into a realm guest.

I don't have any immediate plans to work on nVHE - my focus is getting
the basic support merged. But I know there was some interest to ensure
that pKVM and CCA would be able to co-exist on a platform so I expect it
will come in some form or another.

Thanks,
Steve
