This is the problem. We can't add WRITE permission by default. I believe
you may have MAP_PRIVATE mapping and it has to be mapped as READ only
and on a permission fault, we replace it with a writable page. By
overriding the WRITE permission, you let the guest write to a page
that may not be seen by the VMM.

We identified this as a bug in the KVM driver in this series (reported
by Lorenzo) and there is a corresponding tf-RMM change that is required
to get this working. So, please could you wait until the next series
when this will be addressed ? Or you could switch to using MAP_SHARED
for the "shared" memory in the memslot.
