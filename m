Unfortunately, no. The page was transferred to the Realm world (with
rmi_delegate_page() above the retry: ). If we fail to bring it back,
that page is still in the Realm PAS and any access to it by the normal
world would result in a GPF and eventually bring down the system
if it happens from the kernel.

We don't expect that undelegate to fail. The granule_delegate()
should fail if the page was already in use by the RMM for some
purpose (e.g., already mapped at the IPA, because VMM issued
DATA_MAP_INIT twice. Even with the relaxation coming in the
RMM, we will mandate that the "populate" cases will request
strict conditions for granule delegate).

Please note that this is NOT the "unmap" failure, but it is
"Bring the page back to the NS world" failure that causes
the WARN_ON and the leaking.

This is not true for CCA. Like I said above, touching the page in Realm
PAS is going to be disastrous for the Host.

Yep, we could move it there.

Ack.
