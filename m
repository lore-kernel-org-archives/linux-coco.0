Not for arch code, which is the trickiest bit to handle.

arch/$(ARCH)/kvm/kvm_arch.h is the obvious approach.  Code in virt/kvm can =
reach
arch/$(ARCH)/kvm, we just need to add it to the include path.  That's why I=
 was
working on unifying the include definitions.

Consolidating includes and creating arch/$(ARCH)/kvm/kvm_arch.h should be m=
ore
doable, what has failed spectacularly over and over is effectively trying t=
o hide
most of asm/kvm_host.h, which sounds *really* stupid when I phrase it that =
way :-)

Note, we've scrapped upstreaming multi-KVM, and I don't see it ever getting=
 accepted
upstream, as live update is far superior, e.g. isn't limited to just KVM, d=
oesn't
have the same orchestration or testing problems, etc.

And FWIW, today, you _can_ reload a new (or old) KVM module without rebuild=
ing
the kernel or rebooting the host, it's just that you can't modify certain s=
tructures.
