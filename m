Most importantly, having core TDX make assumptions based on the struct page and/or
folio will create subtle dependencies that are easily avoided.

Yes.

From https://lore.kernel.org/all/aWgyhmTJphGQqO0Y@google.com:

 : I'm not at all opposed to backing guest_memfd with "struct page", quite the
 : opposite.  What I don't want is to bake assumptions into KVM code that doesn't
 : _require_ struct page, because that has cause KVM immense pain in the past.
 : 
 : And I'm strongly opposed to KVM special-casing TDX or anything else, precisely
 : because we struggled through all that pain so that KVM would work better with
 : memory that isn't backed by "struct page", or more specifically, memory that has
 : an associated "struct page", but isn't managed by core MM, e.g. isn't refcounted.
