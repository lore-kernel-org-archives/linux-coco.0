Thank you for the clarification. That makes sense.

I agree that the non-RFC patch should wait until your series has landed.
Before that, however, I'd like to send an RFC patch to gather feedback
on the design from the community while your series is still under
review. I don't expect the RFC to interfere with the upstreaming of your
series.

Thanks,
Kohei.
