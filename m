How many vCPUs?  And were the VMs actually accepting/faulting all 16GiB?

There's also a noisy neighbor problem lurking.  E.g. malicious/buggy VM spams
private<=>shared conversions and thus interferes with PAMT allocations for other
VMs.

Isn't the SEAMCALL done while holding the spinlock?  I assume the latency of the
SEAMCALL is easily the long pole in the flow.

Maybe not for TDX, but we have lots and lots of hard numbers for why taking mmu_lock
for write is problematic.  Even if TDX VMs don't exhibit the same patterns *today*
as "normal" VMs, i.e. don't suffer the same performance blips, nothing guarantees
that will always hold true.

Heh, too late, I saw it when this was first posted.  And to be honest, my initial
reaction was very much "absolutely not" (though Rated R, not PG).  Now that I've
had time to think things through, I'm not _totally_ opposed to having a spinlock
in the page fault path, but my overall sentiment remains the same.

For mmu_lock and related SPTE operations, I was super adamant about not taking
exclusive locks because based on our experience with the TDP MMU, converting flows
from exclusive to shared is usually significantly more work than developing code
for "shared mode" straightaway (and you note above, that wasn't trivial for TDX).
And importantly, those code paths were largely solved problems.  I.e. I didn't
want to get into a situation where TDX undid the parallelization of the TDP MMU,
and then had to add it back after the fact.

I think the same holds true here.  I'm not completely opposed to introducing a
spinlock, but I want to either have a very high level of confidence that the lock
won't introduce jitter/delay (I have low confidence on this front, at least in
the proposed patches), or have super clear line of sight to making the contention
irrelevant, without having to rip apart the code.

My biggest question at this point is: why is all of this being done on-demand?
IIUC, we swung from "allocate all PAMT_4K pages upfront" to "allocate all PAMT_4K
pages at the last possible moment".  Neither of those seems ideal.

E.g. for things like TDCS pages and to some extent non-leaf S-EPT pages, on-demand
PAMT management seems reasonable.  But for PAMTs that are used to track guest-assigned
memory, which is the vaaast majority of PAMT memory, why not hook guest_memfd?
I.e. setup PAMT crud when guest_memfd is populated, not when the memory is mapped
into the guest.  That way setups that cares about guest boot time can preallocate
guest_memfd in order to get the PAMT stuff out of the way.

You could do the same thing by prefaulting guest memory, but TDX has limitations
there, and I see very little value in precisely reclaiming PAMT memory when a
leaf S-EPT is zapped, i.e. when a page is converted from private=>shared.  As
above, that's just asking for noisy neighbor issues.

The complaints with static PAMT are that it required burning 0.4% of memory even
if the host isn't actively running TDX VMs.  Burning 0.4% of the memory assigned
to a guest, regardless of whether it's map private or shared, seems acceptable,
and I think would give us a lot more flexibility in avoiding locking issues.

Similarly, we could bind a PAMT to non-leaf S-EPT pages during mmu_topup_memory_caches(),
i.e. when arch.mmu_external_spt_cache is filled.  Then there would be no need for
a separate vcpu->arch.pamt_page_cache, and more work would be done outside of
mmu_lock.  Freeing SPTs would still be done under mmu_lock (I think), but that
should be a much rarer operation.
