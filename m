yeah. I had the same feeling that bring up the reduced overhead is not 
acceptable.

In what case it needs to marshall written registers back? Can you elaborate?

The initial purpose of writing the code was to find if any case/path in 
KVM that consumes the GPRs for TDX unexpectedly. Not only for the 
hypercall/MSR emulation paths. There are lots of paths in KVM consuming 
the GPRs. It's difficult to aduit every path to ensure either a) it 
won't be reachable by TDX or b) KVM syncs the valid data to the GPRs 
before accessed by TDX.
