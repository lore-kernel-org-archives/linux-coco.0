Hi Marc,

I've just posted v16 before looking at these - I didn't want to delay
posting before responding as I'm going to be on holiday for a week after
today. Apologies that I haven't addressed these comments in v16.

It looks like I've screwed up what goes in which patch. The real change
is in patch 22 where this 'only_shared' property gets passed down to
kvm_realm_unmap_range(). There it's used to decide whether the private
range should be unmapped or not.

The reason for this is kvm_unmap_gfn_range() which has a 'attr_filter'
member of 'kvm_gfn_range' which can specify KVM_FILTER_PRIVATE. Which is
used in __kvm_gmem_set_attributes() so choose whether to invalidate the
private or shared part of a gmem range.

The issue on CCA is that invalidating the private mapping is destructive
- if the guest doesn't agree to it then the guest will not be able to
continue executing. For the shared part this isn't a problem (we can
refault the address).

Clearly I've screwed up the patch ordering here, but I'm not sure quite
how to structure the APIs better to avoid adding this argument.

Thanks,
Steve
