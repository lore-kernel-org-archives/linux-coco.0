[Reposting it here from Linaro Open Discussion List for more eyes to look a=

Hello,
I have recently started to dabble with ARM CCA stuff and check if our
recent changes to support vCPU Hotplug in ARM64 can work in the realm
world. I have realized that in the RMM specification[1] PSCI_CPU_ON
command(B5.3.3) does not handles the PSCI_DENIED return code(B5.4.2),
from the host. This might be required to support vCPU Hotplug feature
in the realm world in future. vCPU Hotplug is an important feature to
support kata-containers in realm world as it reduces the VM boot time
and facilitates dynamic adjustment of vCPUs (which I think should be
true even with Realm world as current implementation only makes use
of the PSCI_ON/OFF to realize the Hotplug look-like effect?)


As per our recent changes [2], [3] related to support vCPU Hotplug on
ARM64, we handle the guest exits due to SMC/HVC Hypercall in the
user-space i.e. VMM/Qemu. In realm world, REC Exits to host due to
PSCI_CPU_ON should undergo similar policy checks and I think,

1. Host should *deny* to online the target vCPUs which are NOT plugged
2. This means target REC should be denied by host. Can host call
   RMI_PSCI_COMPETE in such s case?=20
3. The *return* value (B5.3.3.1.3 Output values) should be PSCI_DENIED
4. Failure condition (B5.3.3.2) should be amended with
   runnable pre: target_rec.flags.runnable =3D=3D NOT_RUNNABLE (?)
            post: result =3D=3D PSCI_DENIED (?)
5. Change would also be required in the flow (D1.4 PSCI flows) depicting=20
   PSCI_CPU_ON flow (D1.4.1)
 =20

I do understand that ARM CCA support is in its infancy stage and
discussing about vCPU Hotplug in realm world seem to be a far-fetched
idea right now. But specification changes require lot of time and if
this change is really required then it should be further discussed
within ARM.=20

Many thanks!


Bes regards
Salil
